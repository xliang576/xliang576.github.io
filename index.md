## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Ocean Dynamics](https://odyn-standrews.github.io/) group in [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/). My PhD research focus on how the Southern Ocean circulates tracers (heat, carbon, oxygen, nutrients, etc.), including the interaction between different scales of ocean motions, and the spatial and temporal variability. The Southern Ocean is a crucial connection between different ocean basins and between the abyss to the upper ocean and atmosphere. It transports heat, moisture, and carbon around the globe, thus having huge implication on the global climate. I will apply ocean model analysis and theoretical ideas to better understand the mechanisms that drive tracer transport and their potential response to the changing climate.

Before coming to St Andrews, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Nanjing University.
